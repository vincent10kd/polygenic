Title: Efficient and User-friendly P+T Polygenic Risk Score Creation with Summary Statistics
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Vincent ten Cate, PhD

Description: An efficient and user-friendly pipeline to retrieve trait-related genetic variants 
    (including pQTLS) previously identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to quickly 
    extract them from chromosome .vcf files and Tabix files, and to convert them into a pruning + 
    thresholding polygenic risk score (PRS) based on GWAS summary statistics.
